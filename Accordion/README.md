# Accordion

## Build a Terms & Conditions Accordion

This project implements a Terms & Conditions accordion with the following features:

- Open and close the accordion by clicking on the component.
- Only one accordion item can be open at a time. Clicking on a different accordion item will close the previously opened one.
- Add checkboxes to each accordion item.
- Toggle between checked and unchecked states for the checkboxes.
- Clicking on a checkbox should not open/close the accordion, but only toggle the checkbox state.
- Add a submit button that is disabled until all checkboxes are checked.
